# Robin Wilson

I'm a freelance data scientist and software developer, specialising in geographic data. I've worked on building large-scale satellite image processing systems for a multi-national mining company, air quality mapping from satellite data and real-time ground sensors, large-scale mobile-phone data analysis for humanitarian purposes, and robust storage of shipping data for the UK Navy.

For more information, please see [my website](http://www.rtwilson.com) and [my blog](http://blog.rtwilson.com/), and [contact me](mailto:robin@rtwilson.com) if you're interested in working with me.

I also maintain the [Free GIS Data list](https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/).
